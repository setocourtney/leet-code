# Problem Solving Approach
### Step 1: Understand Problem
	1. Restate problem in your own words
	2. Inputs
	3. Outputs
	4. All the information available to get the output
	5. Data Structure names / types


### Step 2: Examples
	* Expected input / output results - possible inputs ( special characters, white space) and what does the output look like (object, string, etc.)
	* Edge cases - what happens when null or invalid inputs are used


### Step 3: Break it Down
	* Pseudo code or steps of the problem


### Step 4: Solve the Problem
	* If there are things you can't remember / don't know skip and go back later
	* Complete what you can


### Step 5: Reflect & Refactor
	* What would you do differently? What would you improve?
	* What would you research?
	* Can you improve performance?
